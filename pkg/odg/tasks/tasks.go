// Package tasks provides tasks for submitting orphan resources discovered by
// Inventory as findings to the Open Delivery Gear API.
//
// The flow for submitting findings to the Delivery Service API is as follows.
//
// 1. Fetch orphan resources from Inventory
//
// Get the orphan resources from Inventory first, then convert them to
// findings, which the Delivery Service understands.
//
// 2. Wipe out old/previous findings for the artefact type
//
// We need to delete the old/previous findings for the artefact type
// associated with the component name and version. This ensures no old
// entries exist in the database, since the Delivery Service does not
// have a retention mechanism for cleaning up such findings.
//
// Also, we need to delete old/previous runtime artefacts for each finding.
//
// 3. Submit the orphan resources from step 1
//
// The latest orphan resources fetched from step 1 are submitted to the
// Delivery Service API.
//
// 4. Create runtime artefacts, so that findings can be evaluated and compliance
// issues created or updated for them.
//
// If we have no orphan resources to report, then we don't report anything to
// the remote API.
